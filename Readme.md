YamNet is an unofficial Yammer REST API wrapper based on the the CodePlex
[ContractMeow](http://yammercontractmeow.codeplex.com/) project.

The goal of this library is to provide a ready-to-use .Net wrapper for Yammer's REST API,
distributable via NuGet, and reusable in both conventional solutions (web / desktop) or
mobile, by packaging it as a self-contained Portable Class Library (PCL).
